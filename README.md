# PathPlanning
Path Planning Algorithms ROS2 based visualization

## Overview
This project focuses on two main components: 
- **Path Planning Algorithms -  Deeper understanding**
- **Visualization** using RViz

## Project Components

### 1. Environment with Obstacles
  - **Description**: Create a text file that details the positions of obstacles and free spaces in a map. This file is then used to display the grid map in RViz.
  - **Grid map file** (e.g., `grid_map.txt`)
    ```
    1 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 1 0
    ```

### 2. Start Pose
  - **Description**: Define the initial position of the entity (robot) in the environment. This position is set by the user through RViz.
  - **Setting Start Pose**: 
    - In RViz, use the interface to select the start position on the grid map.
    - Ensure the start pose is in a free space (not on an obstacle).
    - This position will be the beginning point for the path planning algorithm.

### 3. End Pose
  - **Description**: Define the goal position of the entity (robot) in the environment. This position is set by the user through RViz.
  - **Setting End Pose**: 
    - In RViz, use the interface to select the end position on the grid map.
    - Ensure the end pose is in a free space (not on an obstacle).
    - This position will be the target point for the path planning algorithm.

### 4. Path
  - **Description**: The computed path from the start pose to the end pose, avoiding obstacles. This path is generated by the selected path planning algorithm.
  - **Path Computation**: 
    - Load the grid map and set the start and end poses in RViz.
    - Select the desired path planning algorithm from the RViz panel.
    - Compute the path using the "Compute Path" button.
    - The algorithm will consider the environment and generate an optimal path, which will be displayed in RViz.

## RViz Panel Design to be implemented:

## Future TODOs of this projects are , 
1. **To Save the  generated Path**
2. **To compare multiple Path Planning Algorithm Results**
3. **To Pause and to Change the Algorithm During Path Planning**
4. **To have Dynamic Change of Obstacles**
5. **To have Dynamic Path Update Based on Obstacle Relocation**
6. **Enabling Dynamic Start/End Pose Relocation**
7. **To have Multiple Goal Points at the Same Time from a Single Start Point**
8. **NavThroughPoses Type Sequence Waypoint-based Path Planning**
    - Algorithm selection for each waypoint
